<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name: Jesse Bridge</strong><br>
<strong>Login: jc219610</strong></p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal for the website is underlined in the information provided from the client, they describe that the current amount of people attending the parties and buying costumes is too low to sustain business. So it?s clear the owners are wanting to attract more attention to the company, to inform people of what the company is about and what they provide to eventually bring more customers and ultimately more income.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>To evaluate the success of the website, I would keep a monthly record of how many emails/ people signing up before the website was published, and then keep a record of how many new people have signed up. I could also use www.Google.com/Analytics to provide information on how many people are have/are visiting the website, so I know if the website Is being noticed by the public.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The client explains that most of the cosplayers are aged 35-50, however they would like a site designed to appeal to a younger audience such as high school students and young adults (13-25) therefore that will be the target audience for this website.</p>
<p>How I plan to target the specified audience in my design:
  <br>
  To target the specified audience, I want to make the website appear more ?fun? and inviting to young adults and students. To make the website more ?fun? I am choosing to use peaceful inviting colours such as blue and white, whereas black and red are darker themed colours which is the opposite of what I want to portray the site to be. Also by using a softer less serious font I hope to invoke the sense from the users that CossiePlay is a place for having fun and being free and not a strict industry, like for example a restaurant.
