	<br>
		<p>	
			The CossiePlay family is:
			Steven Rogers – Steve was a Navy Seal for 37 years before		 			getting interested in hosting parties and helping people 						 			enjoy their fantasies together in a family-friendly, fun 		 			environment.

			Sally Rogers – After only 6 weeks of her first dress-making course, Sally was already designing and sewing elaborate ball gowns and costumes that amazed her instructors. 10 years later and she’s making even more amazing creations for happy customers.
