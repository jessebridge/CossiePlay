 	<h2> Cosplay</h2>
		<p>	
		Cosplay, a portmanteau of the words costume play, is a performance<br> art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion<br> accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact<br> to create a subculture and a broader use of the term "cosplay" applies<br> to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage

			Favorite sources include manga and anime, comic books and cartoons,<br> video games, and live-action films and television series. The rapid<br> growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since 1990<br> has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of popular culture<br> in Japan and some other parts of Asia and in the Western world
