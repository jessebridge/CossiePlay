		<p>	
			The CossiePlay family is:
			Steven Rogers – Steve was a Navy Seal for 37 years<br> before getting interested in hosting parties and helping people enjoy their<br> fantasies together in a family-friendly, fun environment.

			Sally Rogers – After<br> only 6 weeks of her first dress-making course, Sally was already designing<br> and sewing elaborate ball gowns and costumes that amazed her instructors.<br> 10 years later and she’s making even more amazing creations for happy<br> customers.
